# SharkHunter PMS Build #

The SharkHunter PMS Build (short SHB)is a custom build of Playstation 3 Mediaserver (short PMS http://www.ps3mediaserver.org/). It uses the latest codebase from PMS and adds on a number of plugins and other features. It aims to be a simple "one-click" installer where everything should be bundled so you should be able to just start using it right after installation!

## Installed Plugins ##
SHB bundels the following plugins:

  * **Channels**
> > Channels (http://www.ps3mediaserver.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=9329) is a plugin  that simplifies the way to find media on the web. It comes with support for a lot of channels like SVTPlay,IceFilms,Furk,ARD,YouTube. It increases the number of channels found via NaviX (http://navix.turner3d.net/) where you can find channels like CBS,ABC etc.

  * **GrooveShark**

> The GrooveShark (http://grooveshark.com/) plugin (http://www.ps3mediaserver.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=6861) to PMS. Allows you to find all the music you like online.

  * **PMSEncoder**
> Utility plugin (used by Channels) (http://www.ps3mediaserver.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=6644) to make it possible to play web content streams.

  * **MovieInfo**
> Fetches info about the movie your about to view (http://www.ps3mediaserver.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=2126) like plot, imdb rating etc. Integrated with Channels so you can get the same info (and trailers) for web content.

  * **MediaMonkey**
> Plugin to use the MediaMonkey database. (https://sites.google.com/site/elbotijomm/home/ps3mediaserver-mods).

## SHB unique features ##

SHB also does some add on to do PMS core base. Some requires that the render (or client) supports the feature. The features that are unique to SHB are:

  * **Remote Control**
> Allows you to remote control PMS. Browse the PMS on a "remote control" device and instruct another device (like your TV) to play the movie. Requires a remote control DLNA device or such software (like the SharkMote).

  * **Search**
> The basic PMS only supports browsing (that is you can only browse or walk around in the folder layout you made). This feature allows you to perform searches. Send in a search string and only those things that matches will be returned. Good when using GrooveShark and NaviX.

  * **FolderLimit**
> The PS3 has a nasty limit of only allowing you have 8 folders deep folder trees. The FolderLimit patch tries to overcome this limit by allowing you to continue browsing in a new folder higher up in the hierarchy.

  * **PMS2Go/DLNAAnywhere**
> Now that you placed all your media on this shiny server and you can watch it in your living room wouldn't it be nice to bring your media with you everywhere you go? Maybe show grandma the new baby pictures without uploading it again to some webservice? Then you need PMS2Go. Start and you can access your media from anywhere.

  * **Upload**
Upload new media into PMS. No need to find that cable to your phone (it is faster to use the cable but who can find it?) just start the upload right there and your pictures (or music or video) will make there way onto the server and then you can see view them on your  render (TV/PS3/XBOX).
